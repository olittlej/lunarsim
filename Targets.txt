1) Generate Digital Elevation Model of lunar surface
2) Rover traverse set path
3) Show illumination of sunlight in region
4) show orbits of communication satellite and when in sight of rover

5) Implement local traverse rate as function of terrain type
6) show data storage onboard
7) show power generated on solar panel and battery state as function of rover attitude and solar angle
8) show temperature profile on rover
9) show effects of given fault rate and recovery time

Control Panel:
- Run time
- Distance traveled
- Data storage onboard
- Data transfer
- Line of sight with satellite?
- Current battery power percentage
- Current temperature reading
